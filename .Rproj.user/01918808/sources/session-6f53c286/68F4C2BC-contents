## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=True}
library(esquisse)
esquisse::esquisser(data = fifa_players, viewer = "browser")
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(fifa_players, aes(x = preferred_foot, y = finishing, fill = preferred_foot)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Finishing Ability by Preferred Foot",
       x = "Preferred Foot",
       y = "Finishing Rating") +
  theme_minimal()


library(ggplot2)

data("fifa_players")

library(dplyr)

library(knitr)

library(kableExtra)

summaryTable <- fifa_players %>%

group_by(preferred_foot) %>%

summarise(count=n(),

finishing_min=min(finishing),

finishing_q1=quantile(finishing, probs=.25),

finishing_median=median(finishing),

finishing_q3=quantile(finishing, probs=.75),

finishing_max=max(finishing),

finishing_mean=mean(finishing),

finishing_std=sd(finishing))

formatted_table <- kable(summaryTable, format = "html") %>%

kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
