#Selecting the relevant attributes from the dataset as we do not need all of them

Do taller players have better heading rating?
```{r}
#Create a wrangled data set that only includes necessary values
heights_heading <- fifa_palyers %>% 
  select(height_cm,heading_accuracy)
#Create a scatterplot
ggplot(heights_heading,aes(x = height_cm, y = heading_accuracy)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.7,color = 'red') +
#Create a line of best fit for the scatterplot
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",
        col = "black", se = FALSE, size = 1) +
  labs(title = paste("Height vs. Heading Accuracy")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
