## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```

```{r}
fifa_players %>%
 filter(potential >= 59L & potential <= 95L) %>%
 ggplot() +
  aes(x = potential, y = release_clause_euro) +
  geom_line(colour = "#111C46") +
  labs(x = "Player potential", y = "Release Clause (euros)", title = "Potential vs Release Clause") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
fifa_players %>%
 filter(overall_rating >= 60L & overall_rating <= 94L) %>%
 ggplot() +
  aes(x = overall_rating, y = wage_euro) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 0.5, colour = "#B22222") +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.75) +
  labs(
    x = "Wage (euros)",
    y = "Overall Rating",
    title = "Wage vs Overall Rating"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
